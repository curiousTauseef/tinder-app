# Tinder Android app
An Android app using the Tinder API, which offers some extra features like changing the position, having multiple profiles at the same time, getting all the recommendations at once and getting to know the last connection time of a certain match.

There's still some work left to have a proper login with facebook, so by now, follow this [guide](http://jaanus.com/debugging-http-on-an-android-phone-or-tablet-with-charles-proxy-for-fun-and-profit/) to get the Tinder token and then place it in the build type named MARC_TOKEN.
